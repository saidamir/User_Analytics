# User_Analytics
# Goal
The   purpose   of   this   exercise   is   to   use   the sample   data   to   answer   some   typical questions   for   an   ecommerce   business   using   SQL.
# Data
A   set   of   CSVs   that   correspond   to   6   different   tables   that   represent   fake   data   for ~430,000   orders   across   100   products   over   the   course   of   3   years.
# Schema
The   following   relationships   exist   in   the   data   (foreign   keys   between   the   tables   should   be self-explanatory):
● An   order   has   many   order   line   items
● An   order   line   item   belongs   to   a   product
● A   product   has   one   stock   unit
● An   order   has   one   payment
● A   payment   can   have   a   refund

# Final work
Two charts in .png format
Two csv files containing tables
Three Jupiter Notebook files with the work.
I did all the work in Jupyter Notebooks which can also be looked at the following url (gists). I could also do the work in Mode using SQL and Python.
